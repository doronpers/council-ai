**Date:** January 11, 2026  
**Review Type:** Mobile Web App Optimization Assessment  
**Status:** Implementation Recommendations

## Overview

This document contains recommendations from a Council AI review for mobile optimizations to the web application. These are planned enhancements to improve mobile user experience.

## Planned Optimizations

### 1. PWA/App-Like Features (Planned)

- Add comprehensive mobile media queries
- Optimize touch targets (min-height: 44px for iOS)
- Add landscape orientation support
- Implement dark/light mode support
- Add smooth transitions and hover states

### 3. Mobile-Specific UX Optimizations (Planned)
- Reduce padding on mobile displays
- Single-column grid layout on mobile

- Larger touch-friendly buttons
- Auto-scroll to results on mobile
- Enhanced error handling
- Loading spinner animation

### 4. Accessibility Enhancements (Planned)
- Better color contrast
- Proper focus indicators
- Touch-friendly targets (44px minimum)
- Improved text readability

## Council Recommendations

### Key Priorities

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement lazy loading for images and content
   - Consider code splitting for better initial load times
   - Optimize any images or assets
   - Minimize data transfer where possible

2. **User Testing**
   - Regular user testing with diverse groups
   - Include users with disabilities
   - Test across multiple mobile devices and browsers

3. **Design Simplicity**

   - Follow "Less, but better" principle

### Future Considerations

- Optional sound cues for enhanced accessibility
- Behavioral economics insights (social proof, loss aversion)
